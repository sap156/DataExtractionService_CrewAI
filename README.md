# DataExtractionService_CrewAI

A powerful data extraction service built with CrewAI for web scraping, image text extraction, and file reading.

## üöÄ Features

- **Web Scraping**: Extract data from websites using CSS selectors
- **Structured Output**: Automatically formats scraped data into clean JSON
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Ask questions about scraped data using GPT-4
- **File Reading**: Extract text from uploaded files
- **Image Text Extraction**: Extract text from images using OCR
- **Modular Design**: Built with FastAPI for high performance and scalability

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Node.js (for frontend)

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend Overview

The backend is built using FastAPI and consists of the following components:

### **`main.py`**

The entry point for the backend application. It initializes the FastAPI app and registers the routes for various functionalities:

- **`/api/scrape`**: Handles web scraping requests.
- **`/api/scrape-all`**: Scrapes all visible elements from a webpage.
- **`/api/vision`**: Extracts text from uploaded images using OCR.
- **`/api/read-file`**: Reads and processes uploaded files.
- **`/api/selectors`**: Debugs and inspects CSS selectors for a given webpage.

### **`routes/scrape.py`**

Handles web scraping functionality:

- **`POST /api/scrape`**: Extracts specific elements from a webpage using CSS selectors.
- **`GET /api/scrape-all`**: Scrapes all visible elements from a webpage and formats the data into JSON using OpenAI.
- **Chunking Helper**: Splits large scraped content into smaller chunks for processing by OpenAI.

### **`routes/vision.py`**

Handles image text extraction:

- **`POST /api/vision`**: Uses the VisionTool to extract text from uploaded images and formats the result into structured JSON using OpenAI.
- Includes robust error handling and temporary file cleanup.

### **`routes/file_read.py`**

Handles file reading functionality:

- **`POST /api/read-file`**: Reads the contents of uploaded files (e.g., `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`) and returns structured data.
- Uses the FileReadTool to process the files and manage tasks with CrewAI.

### **`routes/selector_debugger.py`**

Handles CSS selector debugging:

- **`GET /api/selectors`**: Inspects a webpage and returns sample CSS selectors along with a preview of their content.
- Useful for debugging and refining CSS selectors for web scraping.
